#Keymando Configuration Scripts

This repository contains my [Keymando](http://keymando.com) configuration scripts.

It is a good example of using the following features of Keymando:

1. Leveraging the Keymando Command DSL to create actions (saves the need to remap lots of shortcuts)
2. Using the Keymando Automation Engine to automate actions in some of the following apps:
  * Skype
  * iTunes
  * GoToMeeting

##Configuring

Run the bootstrap script to symlink the files in this repository into your home folder. Otherwise, just manually run the Keymando configuration and specify the links to the files and folders.
